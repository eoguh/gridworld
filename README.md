# gridworld AI


This project is a fork of gridworld project by Berkely University, it is widely used to illustrate reinforcement learning to machine learning students.

I completed the codes in a usable format.

To run in q learning mode, you clone the repository, prepare a python 2 virtual enviroment, cd into the folder and run this the command:
python gridworld.py -k 30 -a q

run this to learn about all available options:
python gridworld.py -h
